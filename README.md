## App name: MyWorkshops

## Problem Statement:
As the Education firm providing courses scales it becomes harder for them to manage course database that they offer and also which students have opted for various courses. It becomes very inconvinient when it comes to datastorage in terms of hard copies or even thousand excel sheets as per courses they offer.
If a student wants to apply to other courses then too it becomes hectic! as he needs to fill all the paperwork just to apply.

## Solution
This app is for supporting macro-level education instututes. These instututes can track students who have opted for varied courses. This app will manage the database and has login system for students. It will make most of the database online and thusly educational institutes at macro-scale wont need to manage all the database over huge pile of hard copies! 
It is also a platform for promotion of new courses! so once education institutes have new courses they can have them here. Interested students can therby directly apply.

## Future Scope
In future, many education institutes will reach global scale, expanding their learners internationally. It is very important for these Institutes to exist virtually as it enables maximum reach of information and information litracy. This app enables the database operations for the same, hence an intigral part of this system.
